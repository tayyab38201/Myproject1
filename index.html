                <p class="para">People in village usually live in houses made of bricks, clay or mud. These typically have two or three rooms which house extended families. Although now they prefer living by making separate home for each family (nuclear units) but they
                    don't live far away from their relatives, and they are extending their villages by making more homes. Due to geographical and other socioeconomic diversity, different regions have slightly different physical and social layout. The
                    traditional culture of the village is now subject to change due to the effects upon village society due to rural urbanization,[6] and from the introduction of modern technology, such as pumps and tube wells for irrigation.[7] Resistance
                    to social and cultural changes exists among Pakistani village inhabitants, and varying methods of managing these changes have been tried.
